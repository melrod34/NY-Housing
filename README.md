# NY-Housing
- Leveraged Random Forest, SVM, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), K-Means Clustering, and Linear Regression to accurately predict housing prices.
- Conducted multiple grid searches and hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
- Integrated time series analysis to visualize and forecast price trends over time.
- Evaluated models using performance metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and RÂ², identifying Random Forest as the most effective approach.
- Enhanced dataset quality through data cleaning and feature engineering to improve model predictions.
